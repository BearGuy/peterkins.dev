title = "4 - Being a Digital Nomad"
description = "I talk about my experience being a digital nomad in Asia. The freedom and flexibility of being a digital nomad is tremendous, the cultural experience and perspective is great, and you get to meet some amazing people along the way. However, this is offset by the loneliness and rootlessness that comes from constantly traveling. It's an experience I would recommend everyone to try if they have the chance to do so."
